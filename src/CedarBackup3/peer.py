    Backup peer representing a remote peer in a backup pool.

    This is a class representing a remote (networked) peer in a backup pool.
    Remote peers are backed up using an rcp-compatible copy command.  A remote
    peer has associated with it a name (which must be a valid hostname), a
    collect directory, a working directory and a copy method (an rcp-compatible
    command).

    You can also set an optional local user value.  This username will be used
    as the local user for any remote copies that are required.  It can only be
    used if the root user is executing the backup.  The root user will ``su`` to
    the local user and execute the remote copies as that user.

    The copy method is associated with the peer and not with the actual request
    to copy, because we can envision that each remote host might have a
    different connect method.

        *Note:* Internally, we have to go through and escape any spaces in the

        doesn't seem to be required in the target path. I hope this is portable
        to various different rcp methods, but I guess it might not be (all I have

        is invoked.  If the target already exists, we'll raise an exception.

        *Note:* Apparently, we can't count on all rcp-compatible implementations
        to return sensible errors for some error conditions.  As an example, the
        ``scp`` command in Debian 'woody' returns a zero (normal) status even when
        it can't find a host or if the login or path is invalid.  We try to work
        around this by issuing ``IOError`` the target file does not exist when
        we're done.
