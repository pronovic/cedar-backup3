    # Class documentation
    ######################

    """
    Represents a list of filesystem items.

    This is a generic class that represents a list of filesystem items.  Callers
    can add individual files or directories to the list, or can recursively add
    the contents of a directory.  The class also allows for up-front exclusions
    in several forms (all files, all directories, all items matching a pattern,
    all items whose basename matches a pattern, or all directories containing a
    specific "ignore file").  Symbolic links are typically backed up
    non-recursively, i.e. the link to a directory is backed up, but not the
    contents of that link (we don't want to deal with recursive loops, etc.).

    The custom methods such as :any:`addFile` will only add items if they exist on
    the filesystem and do not match any exclusions that are already in place.
    However, since a FilesystemList is a subclass of Python's standard list
    class, callers can also add items to the list in the usual way, using
    methods like ``append()`` or ``insert()``.  No validations apply to items
    added to the list in this way; however, many list-manipulation methods deal
    "gracefully" with items that don't exist in the filesystem, often by
    ignoring them.

    Once a list has been created, callers can remove individual items from the
    list using standard methods like ``pop()`` or ``remove()`` or they can use
    custom methods to remove specific types of entries or entries which match a
    particular pattern.

    *Note:* Regular expression patterns that apply to paths are assumed to be
    bounded at front and back by the beginning and end of the string, i.e. they
    are treated as if they begin with ``^`` and end with ``$``.  This is true
    whether we are matching a complete path or a basename.

        Adds the contents of a directory to the list.

        The path must exist and must be a directory or a link to a directory.
        The contents of the directory (as well as the directory path itself) will
        be recursively added to the list, subject to any exclusions that are in
        place.  If you only want the directory and its immediate contents to be
        added, then pass in ``recursive=False``.

        *Note:* If a directory's absolute path matches an exclude pattern or path,
        or if the directory contains the configured ignore file, then the
        directory and all of its contents will be recursively excluded from the
        list.

        *Note:* If the passed-in directory happens to be a soft link, it will be
        recursed.  However, the linkDepth parameter controls whether any soft
        links *within* the directory will be recursed.  The link depth is
        maximum depth of the tree at which soft links should be followed.  So, a
        depth of 0 does not follow any soft links, a depth of 1 follows only
        links within the passed-in directory, a depth of 2 follows the links at
        the next level down, etc.

        *Note:* Any invalid soft links (i.e.  soft links that point to
        non-existent items) will be silently ignored.

        *Note:* The :any:`excludeDirs` flag only controls whether any given directory
        path itself is added to the list once it has been discovered.  It does
        *not* modify any behavior related to directory recursion.

        Internal implementation of ``addDirContents``.

        This internal implementation exists due to some refactoring.  Basically,
        some subclasses have a need to add the contents of a directory, but not
        the directory itself.  This is different than the standard ``FilesystemList``
        behavior and actually ends up making a special case out of the first
        call in the recursive chain.  Since I don't want to expose the modified
        interface, ``addDirContents`` ends up being wholly implemented in terms
        of this method.

        The linkDepth parameter controls whether soft links are followed when we
        are adding the contents recursively.  Any recursive calls reduce the
        value by one.  If the value zero or less, then soft links will just be
        added as directories, but will not be followed.  This means that links
        are followed to a *constant depth* starting from the top-most directory.

        There is one difference between soft links and directories: soft links
        that are added recursively are not placed into the list explicitly.  This
        is because if we do add the links recursively, the resulting tar file
        gets a little confused (it has a link and a directory with the same
        name).

           sha.new(open(path).read()).hexdigest()

        Python Cookbook recipe describes how to incrementally generate a hash
        value by reading in chunks of data rather than reading the file all at
        once.  The recipe relies on the the ``update()`` method of the various
        Python hashing algorithms.

        requires 111 seconds.  This implementation requires only 40-45 seconds,
        which is a pretty substantial speed-up.

        Experience shows that reading in around 4kB (4096 bytes) at a time yields
        the best performance.  Smaller reads are quite a bit slower, and larger
        reads don't make much of a difference.  The 4kB number makes me a little
        suspicious, and I think it might be related to the size of a filesystem
        read at the hardware level.  However, I've decided to just hardcode 4096

        Creates a tar file containing the files in the list.

        By default, this method will create uncompressed tar files.  If you pass
        in mode ``'targz'``, then it will create gzipped tar files, and if you
        pass in mode ``'tarbz2'``, then it will create bzipped tar files.

        The tar file will be created as a GNU tar archive, which enables extended
        file name lengths, etc.  Since GNU tar is so prevalent, I've decided that
        the extra functionality out-weighs the disadvantage of not being
        "standard".

        If you pass in ``flat=True``, then a "flat" archive will be created, and
        all of the files will be added to the root of the archive.  So, the file
        ``/tmp/something/whatever.txt`` would be added as just ``whatever.txt``.

        By default, the whole method call fails if there are problems adding any
        of the files to the archive, resulting in an exception.  Under these
        circumstances, callers are advised that they might want to call
        :any:`removeInvalid` and then attempt to extract the tar file a second
        time, since the most common cause of failures is a missing file (a file
        that existed when the list was built, but is gone again by the time the
        tar file is built).

        If you want to, you can pass in ``ignore=True``, and the method will
        ignore errors encountered when adding individual files to the archive
        (but not errors opening and closing the archive itself).

        We'll always attempt to remove the tarfile from disk if an exception will
        be thrown.

        *Note:* No validation is done as to whether the entries in the list are
        files, since only files or soft links should be in an object like this.
        However, to be safe, everything is explicitly added to the tar archive
        non-recursively so it's safe to include soft links to directories.

        *Note:* The Python ``tarfile`` module, which is used internally here, is
        supposed to deal properly with long filenames and links.  In my testing,
        I have found that it appears to be able to add long really long filenames
        to archives, but doesn't do a good job reading them back out, even out of
        an archive it created.  Fortunately, all Cedar Backup does is add files

        """
        Removes unchanged entries from the list.

        This method relies on a digest map as returned from :any:`generateDigestMap`.
        For each entry in ``digestMap``, if the entry also exists in the current
        list *and* the entry in the current list has the same digest value as in
        the map, the entry in the current list will be removed.

        This method offers a convenient way for callers to filter unneeded
        entries from a list.  The idea is that a caller will capture a digest map
        from ``generateDigestMap`` at some point in time (perhaps the beginning of
        the week), and will save off that map using ``pickle`` or some other
        method.  Then, the caller could use this method sometime in the future to
        filter out any unchanged files based on the saved-off map.

        If ``captureDigest`` is passed-in as ``True``, then digest information will
        be captured for the entire list before the removal step occurs using the
        same rules as in :any:`generateDigestMap`.  The check will involve a lookup
        into the complete digest map.

        If ``captureDigest`` is passed in as ``False``, we will only generate a
        digest value for files we actually need to check, and we'll ignore any
        entry in the list which isn't a file that currently exists on disk.

        The return value varies depending on ``captureDigest``, as well.  To
        preserve backwards compatibility, if ``captureDigest`` is ``False``, then
        we'll just return a single value representing the number of entries
        removed.  Otherwise, we'll return a tuple of C{(entries removed, digest
        map)}.  The returned digest map will be in exactly the form returned by
        :any:`generateDigestMap`.

        *Note:* For performance reasons, this method actually ends up rebuilding
        the list from scratch.  First, we build a temporary dictionary containing
        all of the items from the original list.  Then, we remove items as needed
        from the dictionary (which is faster than the equivalent operation on a
        list).  Finally, we replace the contents of the current list based on the
        keys left in the dictionary.  This should be transparent to the caller.

    :any:`FilesystemList`, this class adds functionality to remove items that are
    too young to be purged, and to actually remove each item in the list from
    the filesystem.

    The other main difference is that when you add a directory's contents to a
    purge item list, the directory itself is not added to the list.  This way,
    if someone asks to purge within in ``/opt/backup/collect``, that directory
    doesn't get removed once all of the files within it is gone.

        links *within* the directory will be recursed.  The link depth is

def normalizeFile(path):

    Normalizes a file name.

    On Windows in particular, we often end up with mixed slashes, where

    because you never know what part of a path will have what kind of
    slash.  I've decided to standardize on forward slashes.

    For our purposes, a directory name is normalized by removing the trailing

    perspective passing in ``/path/to/dir/`` and ``/path/to/dir`` are equivalent.

# compareContents() function

def compareContents(path1, path2, verbose=False):
    """
    Compares the contents of two directories to see if they are equivalent.

    The two directories are recursively compared.  First, we check whether they
    contain exactly the same set of files.  Then, we check to see every given
    file has exactly the same contents in both directories.

    This is all relatively simple to implement through the magic of
    :any:`BackupFileList.generateDigestMap`, which knows how to strip a path prefix
    off the front of each entry in the mapping it generates.  This makes our
    comparison as simple as creating a list for each path, then generating a
    digest map for each path and comparing the two.

    If no exception is thrown, the two directories are considered identical.

    If the ``verbose`` flag is ``True``, then an alternate (but slower) method is
    used so that any thrown exception can indicate exactly which file caused the
    comparison to fail.  The thrown ``ValueError`` exception distinguishes
    between the directories containing different files, and containing the same
    files with differing content.

    *Note:* Symlinks are *not* followed for the purposes of this comparison.
