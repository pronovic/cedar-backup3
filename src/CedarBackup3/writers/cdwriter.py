    """
    Class representing a device that knows how to write CD media.

    This is a class representing a device that knows how to write CD media.  It
    provides common operations for the device, such as ejecting the media,
    writing an ISO image to the media, or checking for the current media
    capacity.  It also provides a place to store device attributes, such as
    whether the device supports writing multisession discs, etc.

    This class is implemented in terms of the ``eject`` and ``cdrecord``
    programs, both of which should be available on most UN*X platforms.

    **Image Writer Interface**

    The following methods make up the "image writer" interface shared
    with other kinds of writers (such as DVD writers)::

       __init__
       initializeImage()
       addImageEntry()
       writeImage()
       setImageNewDisc()
       retrieveCapacity()
       getEstimatedImageSize()

    Only these methods will be used by other Cedar Backup functionality
    that expects a compatible image writer.

    The media attribute is also assumed to be available.

    **Media Types**

    This class knows how to write to two different kinds of media, represented
    by the following constants:

       - ``MEDIA_CDR_74``: 74-minute CD-R media (650 MB capacity)
       - ``MEDIA_CDRW_74``: 74-minute CD-RW media (650 MB capacity)
       - ``MEDIA_CDR_80``: 80-minute CD-R media (700 MB capacity)
       - ``MEDIA_CDRW_80``: 80-minute CD-RW media (700 MB capacity)

    Most hardware can read and write both 74-minute and 80-minute CD-R and
    CD-RW media.  Some older drives may only be able to write CD-R media.
    The difference between the two is that CD-RW media can be rewritten
    (erased), while CD-R media cannot be.

    I do not support any other configurations for a couple of reasons.  The
    first is that I've never tested any other kind of media.  The second is
    that anything other than 74 or 80 minute is apparently non-standard.

    **Device Attributes vs. Media Attributes**

    A given writer instance has two different kinds of attributes associated
    with it, which I call device attributes and media attributes.  Device
    attributes are things which can be determined without looking at the
    media, such as whether the drive supports writing multisession disks or
    has a tray.  Media attributes are attributes which vary depending on the
    state of the media, such as the remaining capacity on a disc.  In
    general, device attributes are available via instance variables and are
    constant over the life of an object, while media attributes can be
    retrieved through method calls.

    **Talking to Hardware**

    This class needs to talk to CD writer hardware in two different ways:
    through cdrecord to actually write to the media, and through the
    filesystem to do things like open and close the tray.

    Historically, CdWriter has interacted with cdrecord using the scsiId
    attribute, and with most other utilities using the device attribute.
    This changed somewhat in Cedar Backup 2.9.0.

    When Cedar Backup was first written, the only way to interact with
    cdrecord was by using a SCSI device id.  IDE devices were mapped to
    pseudo-SCSI devices through the kernel.  Later, extended SCSI "methods"
    arrived, and it became common to see ``ATA:1,0,0`` or ``ATAPI:0,0,0`` as a
    way to address IDE hardware.  By late 2006, ``ATA`` and ``ATAPI`` had
    apparently been deprecated in favor of just addressing the IDE device
    directly by name, i.e. ``/dev/cdrw``.

    Because of this latest development, it no longer makes sense to require a
    CdWriter to be created with a SCSI id -- there might not be one.  So, the
    passed-in SCSI id is now optional.  Also, there is now a hardwareId
    attribute.  This attribute is filled in with either the SCSI id (if
    provided) or the device (otherwise).  The hardware id is the value that
    will be passed to cdrecord in the ``dev=`` argument.

    **Testing**

    It's rather difficult to test this code in an automated fashion, even if
    you have access to a physical CD writer drive.  It's even more difficult
    to test it if you are running on some build daemon (think of a Debian
    autobuilder) which can't be expected to have any hardware or any media
    that you could write to.

    Because of this, much of the implementation below is in terms of static
    methods that are supposed to take defined actions based on their
    arguments.  Public methods are then implemented in terms of a series of
    calls to simplistic static methods.  This way, we can test as much as
    possible of the functionality via testing the static methods, while
    hoping that if the static methods are called appropriately, things will
    work properly.  It's not perfect, but it's much better than no testing at
    all.

        Initializes a CD writer object.

        The current user must have write access to the device at the time the
        object is instantiated, or an exception will be thrown.  However, no
        media-related validation is done, and in fact there is no need for any
        media to be in the drive until one of the other media attribute-related
        methods is called.

        The various instance variables such as ``deviceType``, ``deviceVendor``,
        etc. might be ``None``, if we're unable to parse this specific information
        from the ``cdrecord`` output.  This information is just for reference.

        The SCSI id is optional, but the device path is required.  If the SCSI id
        is passed in, then the hardware id attribute will be taken from the SCSI
        id.  Otherwise, the hardware id will be taken from the device.

        If cdrecord improperly detects whether your writer device has a tray and
        can be safely opened and closed, then pass in ``noEject=False``.  This
        will override the properties and the device will never be ejected.

        *Note:* The ``unittest`` parameter should never be set to ``True``
        outside of Cedar Backup code.  It is intended for use in unit testing
        Cedar Backup internals and has no other sensible purpose.

        behavior with the new ejectDelay flag.

        Later, I sometimes ran into issues after writing an image to a disc:
        eject would give errors like "unable to eject, last error: Inappropriate

        information about the properties of the device.

        The output is expected to be a huge long list of strings.  Unfortunately,
        the strings aren't in a completely regular format.  However, the format
        of individual lines seems to be regular enough that we can look for
        specific values.  Two kinds of parsing take place: one kind of parsing
        picks out out specific values like the device id, device vendor, etc.
        The other kind of parsing just sets a boolean flag ``True`` if a matching
        line is found.  All of the parsing is done with regular expressions.

        Right now, pretty much nothing in the output is required and we should
        parse an empty document successfully (albeit resulting in a device that
        can't eject, doesn't have a tray and doesnt't support multisession
        discs).   I had briefly considered erroring out if certain lines weren't
        found or couldn't be parsed, but that seems like a bad idea given that
        most of the information is just for reference.

        The results are returned as a tuple of the object device attributes:
        C{(deviceType, deviceVendor, deviceId, deviceBufferSize,
        deviceSupportsMulti, deviceHasTray, deviceCanEject)}.

    def _parseBoundariesOutput(output):
        """
        Parses the output from a ``cdrecord`` capacity command.

        The ``output`` parameter should be a list of strings as returned from
        ``executeCommand`` for a ``cdrecord`` command with arguments as from
        ``_buildBoundaryArgs``.  The list of strings will be parsed to yield
        information about the capacity of the media in the device.

        Basically, we expect the list of strings to include just one line, a pair
        of values.  There isn't supposed to be whitespace, but we allow it anyway
        in the regular expression.  Any lines below the one line we parse are
        completely ignored.  It would be a good idea to ignore ``stderr`` when
        executing the ``cdrecord`` command that generates output for this method,
        because sometimes ``cdrecord`` spits out kernel warnings about the actual
        output.

        The results are returned as a tuple of (lower, upper) as needed by the
        ``IsoImage`` class.  Note that these values are in terms of ISO sectors,
        not bytes.  Clients should generally consider the boundaries value
        opaque, however.

        *Note:* If the boundaries output can't be parsed, we return ``None``.
