    """
    Class representing a device that knows how to write some kinds of DVD media.

    **Summary**

    This is a class representing a device that knows how to write some kinds
    of DVD media.  It provides common operations for the device, such as
    ejecting the media and writing data to the media.

    This class is implemented in terms of the ``eject`` and ``growisofs``
    utilities, all of which should be available on most UN*X platforms.

    **Image Writer Interface**

    The following methods make up the "image writer" interface shared
    with other kinds of writers::

       __init__
       initializeImage()
       addImageEntry()
       writeImage()
       setImageNewDisc()
       retrieveCapacity()
       getEstimatedImageSize()

    Only these methods will be used by other Cedar Backup functionality
    that expects a compatible image writer.

    The media attribute is also assumed to be available.

    Unlike the ``CdWriter``, the ``DvdWriter`` can only operate in terms of
    filesystem devices, not SCSI devices.  So, although the constructor
    interface accepts a SCSI device parameter for the sake of compatibility,
    it's not used.

    **Media Types**

    This class knows how to write to DVD+R and DVD+RW media, represented
    by the following constants:

       - ``MEDIA_DVDPLUSR``: DVD+R media (4.4 GB capacity)
       - ``MEDIA_DVDPLUSRW``: DVD+RW media (4.4 GB capacity)

    The difference is that DVD+RW media can be rewritten, while DVD+R media
    cannot be (although at present, ``DvdWriter`` does not really
    differentiate between rewritable and non-rewritable media).

    The capacities are 4.4 GB because Cedar Backup deals in "true" gigabytes
    of 1024*1024*1024 bytes per gigabyte.

    The underlying ``growisofs`` utility does support other kinds of media
    (including DVD-R, DVD-RW and BlueRay) which work somewhat differently
    than standard DVD+R and DVD+RW media.  I don't support these other kinds
    of media because I haven't had any opportunity to work with them.  The
    same goes for dual-layer media of any type.

    **Device Attributes vs. Media Attributes**

    As with the cdwriter functionality, a given dvdwriter instance has two
    different kinds of attributes associated with it.  I call these device
    attributes and media attributes.

    Device attributes are things which can be determined without looking at
    the media.  Media attributes are attributes which vary depending on the
    state of the media.  In general, device attributes are available via
    instance variables and are constant over the life of an object, while
    media attributes can be retrieved through method calls.

    Compared to cdwriters, dvdwriters have very few attributes.  This is due
    to differences between the way ``growisofs`` works relative to
    ``cdrecord``.

    **Media Capacity**

    One major difference between the ``cdrecord``/``mkisofs`` utilities used by
    the cdwriter class and the ``growisofs`` utility used here is that the
    process of estimating remaining capacity and image size is more
    straightforward with ``cdrecord``/``mkisofs`` than with ``growisofs``.

    In this class, remaining capacity is calculated by asking doing a dry run
    of ``growisofs`` and grabbing some information from the output of that
    command.  Image size is estimated by asking the ``IsoImage`` class for an
    estimate and then adding on a "fudge factor" determined through
    experimentation.

    **Testing**

    It's rather difficult to test this code in an automated fashion, even if
    you have access to a physical DVD writer drive.  It's even more difficult
    to test it if you are running on some build daemon (think of a Debian
    autobuilder) which can't be expected to have any hardware or any media
    that you could write to.

    Because of this, some of the implementation below is in terms of static
    methods that are supposed to take defined actions based on their
    arguments.  Public methods are then implemented in terms of a series of
    calls to simplistic static methods.  This way, we can test as much as
    possible of the "difficult" functionality via testing the static methods,
    while hoping that if the static methods are called appropriately, things
    will work properly.  It's not perfect, but it's much better than no
    testing at all.

        Initializes a DVD writer object.

        Since ``growisofs`` can only address devices using the device path (i.e.
        ``/dev/dvd``), the hardware id will always be set based on the device.  If
        passed in, it will be saved for reference purposes only.

        We have no way to query the device to ask whether it has a tray or can be
        safely opened and closed.  So, the ``noEject`` flag is used to set these
        values.  If ``noEject=False``, then we assume a tray exists and open/close
        is safe.  If ``noEject=True``, then we assume that there is no tray and
        open/close is not safe.

        The SCSI id, if provided, is in the form ``[<method>:]scsibus,target,lun``.

        *Note:* The ``unittest`` parameter should never be set to ``True``

        Starting with Debian wheezy on my backup hardware, I started seeing
        consistent problems with the eject command.  I couldn't tell whether
        these problems were due to the device management system or to the new
        kernel (3.2.0).  Initially, I saw simple eject failures, possibly because
        I was opening and closing the tray too quickly.  I worked around that
        behavior with the new ejectDelay flag.

        Later, I sometimes ran into issues after writing an image to a disc:
        eject would give errors like "unable to eject, last error: Inappropriate
        ioctl for device".  Various sources online (like Ubuntu bug #875543)
        suggested that the drive was being locked somehow, and that the
        workaround was to run 'eject -i off' to unlock it.  Sure enough, that
        fixed the problem for me, so now it's a normal error-handling strategy.
