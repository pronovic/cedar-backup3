"""
Provides the implementation for various knapsack algorithms.

Knapsack algorithms are "fit" algorithms, used to take a set of "things" and
decide on the optimal way to fit them into some container.  The focus of this
code is to fit files onto a disc, although the interface (in terms of item,
item size and capacity size, with no units) is generic enough that it can
be applied to items other than files.

All of the algorithms implemented below assume that "optimal" means "use up as
much of the disc's capacity as possible", but each produces slightly different
results.  For instance, the best fit and first fit algorithms tend to include
fewer files than the worst fit and alternate fit algorithms, even if they use
the disc space more efficiently.

Usually, for a given set of circumstances, it will be obvious to a human which
algorithm is the right one to use, based on trade-offs between number of files
included and ideal space utilization.  It's a little more difficult to do this
programmatically.  For Cedar Backup's purposes (i.e. trying to fit a small
number of collect-directory tarfiles onto a disc), worst-fit is probably the
best choice if the goal is to include as many of the collect directories as
possible.

# firstFit() function
######################


def firstFit(items, capacity):

    """
    Implements the first-fit knapsack algorithm.

    The first-fit algorithm proceeds through an unsorted list of items until
    running out of items or meeting capacity exactly.  If capacity is exceeded,
    the item that caused capacity to be exceeded is thrown away and the next one
    is tried.  This algorithm generally performs more poorly than the other
    algorithms both in terms of capacity utilization and item utilization, but
    can be as much as an order of magnitude faster on large lists of items
    because it doesn't require any sorting.

    The "size" values in the items and capacity arguments must be comparable,
    but they are unitless from the perspective of this function.  Zero-sized
    items and capacity are considered degenerate cases.  If capacity is zero,
    no items fit, period, even if the items list contains zero-sized items.

    The dictionary is indexed by its key, and then includes its key.  This
    seems kind of strange on first glance.  It works this way to facilitate
    easy sorting of the list on key if needed.

    The function assumes that the list of items may be used destructively, if
    needed.  This avoids the overhead of having the function make a copy of the
    list, if this is not required.  Callers should pass ``items.copy()`` if they
    do not want their version of the list modified.

    The function returns a list of chosen items and the unitless amount of
    capacity used by the items.

    Args:
       items (dictionary, keyed on item, of ``item, size`` tuples, item as string and size as integer): Items to operate on
       capacity (integer): Capacity of container to fit to

def bestFit(items, capacity):

    """
    Implements the best-fit knapsack algorithm.

    The best-fit algorithm proceeds through a sorted list of items (sorted from
    largest to smallest) until running out of items or meeting capacity exactly.
    If capacity is exceeded, the item that caused capacity to be exceeded is
    thrown away and the next one is tried.  The algorithm effectively includes
    the minimum number of items possible in its search for optimal capacity
    utilization.  For large lists of mixed-size items, it's not ususual to see
    the algorithm achieve 100% capacity utilization by including fewer than 1%
    of the items.  Probably because it often has to look at fewer of the items
    before completing, it tends to be a little faster than the worst-fit or
    alternate-fit algorithms.

def alternateFit(items, capacity):

    Implements the alternate-fit knapsack algorithm.

    This algorithm (which I'm calling "alternate-fit" as in "alternate from one
    to the other") tries to balance small and large items to achieve better
    end-of-disk performance.  Instead of just working one direction through a
    list, it alternately works from the start and end of a sorted list (sorted
    from smallest to largest), throwing away any item which causes capacity to
    be exceeded.  The algorithm tends to be slower than the best-fit and
    first-fit algorithms, and slightly faster than the worst-fit algorithm,
    probably because of the number of items it considers on average before
    completing.  It often achieves slightly better capacity utilization than the
    worst-fit algorithm, while including slighly fewer items.
