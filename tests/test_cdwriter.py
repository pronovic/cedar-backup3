"""
Unit tests for CedarBackup3/writers/cdwriter.py.

This code was consolidated from writertests.py and imagetests.py at the same
time cdwriter.py was created.

Code Coverage
=============

   This module contains individual tests for the public classes implemented in
   cdwriter.py.

   Unfortunately, it's rather difficult to test this code in an automated
   fashion, even if you have access to a physical CD writer drive.  It's even
   more difficult to test it if you are running on some build daemon (think of
   a Debian autobuilder) which can't be expected to have any hardware or any
   media that you could write to.  Because of this, there aren't any tests
   below that actually cause CD media to be written to.

   As a compromise, much of the implementation is in terms of private static
   methods that have well-defined behaviors.  Normally, I prefer to only test
   the public interface to class, but in this case, testing the private methods
   will help give us some reasonable confidence in the code, even if we can't
   write a physical disc or can't run all of the tests.  This isn't perfect,
   but it's better than nothing.

Naming Conventions
==================

   I prefer to avoid large unit tests which validate more than one piece of
   functionality, and I prefer to avoid using overly descriptive (read: long)
   test names, as well.  Instead, I use lots of very small tests that each
   validate one specific thing.  These small tests are then named with an index
   number, yielding something like ``testAddDir_001`` or ``testValidate_010``.
   Each method has a docstring describing what it's supposed to accomplish.  I
   feel that this makes it easier to judge how important a given failure is,
   and also makes it somewhat easier to diagnose and fix individual problems.

Full vs. Reduced Tests
======================

   Some Cedar Backup regression tests require a specialized environment in
   order to run successfully.  This environment won't necessarily be available
   on every build system out there (for instance, on a Debian autobuilder).
   Because of this, the default behavior is to run a "reduced feature set" test
   suite that has no surprising system, kernel or network requirements.  There
   are no special dependencies for these tests.

   I used to try and run tests against an actual device, to make sure that this
   worked.  However, those tests ended up being kind of bogus, because my main
   development environment doesn't have a writer, and even if it had one, any
   device with the same name on another user's system wouldn't necessarily
   return sensible results.  That's just pointless.  We'll just have to rely on
   the other tests to make sure that things seem sensible.
