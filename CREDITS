Most of the source code in this project was written by Kenneth J.
Pronovici.  Some portions have been based on other pieces of open-source
software, as indicated in the source code itself.

Unless otherwise indicated, all Cedar Backup source code is Copyright (c)
2004-2011,2013-2017,2019 Kenneth J. Pronovici and is released under the GNU
General Public License, version 2.  The contents of the GNU General Public
License can be found in the LICENSE file, or can be downloaded from

Various patches have been contributed to the Cedar Backup codebase by
Dmitry Rutsky.  Major contributions include the initial implementation for
the optimized media blanking strategy as well as improvements to the DVD
writer implementation.

The PostgreSQL extension was contributed by Antoine Beaupre ("The
Anarcat"), based on the existing MySQL extension.

Lukasz K. Nowak helped debug the split functionality and also provided
patches for parts of the documentation.

Zoran Bosnjak contributed changes to collect.py to implement recursive
collect behavior based on recursion level.

Jan Medlock contributed patches to improve the manpage and to support
recent versions of the /usr/bin/split command.

Minor code snippets derived from newsgroup and mailing list postings are
not generally attributed unless I used someone else's source code verbatim.

Source code annotated as "(c) 2001, 2002 Python Software Foundation" was
